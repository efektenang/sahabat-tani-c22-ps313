## Project Goals <br>
The result of this project is to educate and provide information to rice farmers to detect early what diseases are being experienced by the farmers' rice plants through the detection of their rice leaf images. With this application, we hope that there will be no crop failure caused by farmers' ignorance about rice diseases and hope that we can continue to increase the national stock in Indonesia.
